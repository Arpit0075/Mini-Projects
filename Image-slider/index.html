          Batman is a superhero who appears in American comic books published by
          DC Comics. Batman was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill
          Finger, and debuted in the 27th issue of the comic book Detective
          Comics on March 30, 1939. In the DC Universe continuity, Batman is the
          alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and
          industrialist who resides in Gotham City. Batman's origin story
          features him swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the
          murder of his parents Thomas and Martha; he trains himself physically
          and intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and monitors the
          Gotham streets at night. Kane, Finger, and other creators accompanied
          Batman with supporting characters, including his sidekick Robin;
          allies Alfred Pennyworth, James Gordon, and Catwoman; and foes such as
          the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face and Joker.
